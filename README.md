# Ames Housing Project  
**Predictive modeling and feature engineering on the Ames, Iowa housing dataset — built for real-world deployment and insight generation.**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, I developed a robust **regression model** to predict **house sale prices** using the rich Ames Housing dataset (70+ features). I applied a complete data science pipeline — from raw data exploration and cleaning to model selection, tuning, and evaluation. The goal: build a model that generalizes well and extract actionable insights about what drives housing values.

This work demonstrates skills relevant to roles in data science, machine learning engineering, and analytics — including feature engineering, model validation, and interpretability.

## 📘 Notebooks & Key Contributions

### **housing-regression.ipynb**

This is the main analytical and modeling notebook. Below is an expanded look at its major steps and the skills each conveys:

| Step | Description | Skills & Tools Showcased |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration** | Inspect raw features, data types, missing values, distributions | `pandas`, `seaborn`, domain intuition |
| **2. Data Cleaning / Imputation** | Handle missing values (imputation, deletion, domain-informed fill-ins), treat outliers, unify data types | Data wrangling, handling edge cases, clean pipelines |
| **3. Feature Engineering & Transformations** | Create new features (e.g. interaction terms, polynomial features, combining categories), encode categorical variables (one-hot, ordinal), scale/normalize numeric features | Feature engineering, encoding strategies, domain insight |
| **4. Train/Test Split & Cross-Validation** | Partition data properly, use cross-validation (e.g. k-fold) to avoid overfitting | Sound experimental design, preventing data leakage |
| **5. Model Building & Hyperparameter Tuning** | Train multiple models (e.g. linear regression, Lasso, Ridge), perform grid search or randomized search over hyperparameters | `scikit-learn`, model comparison, hyperparameter optimization |
| **6. Model Evaluation & Interpretation** | Evaluate on validation/test splits using metrics (RMSE, MAE, maybe R²), compare against baseline model, analyze residuals, check assumptions | Performance metrics, error analysis, diagnostic plots |
| **7. Deployable Pipeline / Code Organization** | Wrap feature transformations + predictions into a pipeline or modular functions | Reproducibility, code modularity, maintainability |
| **8. Insights & Business Interpretation** | Translate model coefficients or feature importances into real-world housing market insights (e.g. which features most influence house prices) | Storytelling, domain relevance, stakeholder communication |

### **suggestions.md**

In this file, I reflect on:

- Limitations in modeling and data (e.g. non-linearity, unobserved variables)  
- Next improvements (ensemble models, feature selection, stacking, more advanced regression)  
- How this model could be adapted for deployment (e.g. API wrapping, live scoring)  
- Ideas for adding explainability (SHAP, LIME) or packaged dashboards

- **Feature engineering & transformations**: Creating meaningful derived features, dealing with categorical variables  
- **Model selection and hyperparameter tuning**: Systematic comparison of algorithms and fine-tuning  
- **Cross-validation & robust validation**: Ensuring model generalization and avoiding overfitting  
- **Interpretability & actionable insight**: Going beyond “black box” to explain what matters in house pricing  
- **Code modularity & pipeline design**: Structure for reusability and clarity  
- **Critical thinking about limitations & next steps**: Recognizing what was done well and what to improve
